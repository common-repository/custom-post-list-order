== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set different sorting conditions for each page? =

Currently, only uniform sorting conditions are supported.

= The article list is not displayed after setting "Order by Page Views"? =

This plugin starts getting page views data after installed and activated. So, it takes some time before the article list to be displayed in page view order.
Please wait a few hours.
